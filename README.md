# Radial Documentation

Radial was created to help me understand, record, and put into practice the
intersection between [Twelve-Factor App](http://12factor.net) best-practices and
[Docker](http://docker.io) features. The results are my own topology strategies
for manually implementing Docker containers in a predictable, intuitive, and flexible way.

I use the analogy of an "Axle", a "Hub", and a "Spoke" to help conceptually link
together Docker containers into different classes based on what we need the
entire stack (the "Wheel") to be doing. 

This is the repository for the documentation. Please continue
[here](http://radial.viewdocs.io/docs) to actually read it.
