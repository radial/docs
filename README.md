# Radial Documentation

Radial was created to help me understand, record, and put into practice the
intersection between [Twelve-Factor App](http://12factor.net) best-practices and
[Docker](http://docker.io) features. The results are my own topology strategies
for manually implementing Docker containers in a predictable and scalable way.

I use the analogy of an "Axle", a "Hub", and a "Spoke" to help conceptually link
together Docker containers into different classes based on what we need the
entire stack (the "Wheel") to be doing. For more details, please check out the
rest of the documentation.
