Just like all general purpose tools, there are many ways to do things and
sometimes it's unclear how to put different combinations of best practices
together.

Docker introduces a lot of different possibilities for one's standard workflow.
In trying to understand all these possibilities and come up with a complete and
scalable strategy for my personal use, I am documenting it and organizing it
here for all to critique, use, and make suggestions to. It should be a good
primer for enthusiasts like myself to start to understand how the different
features of docker meet the needs of hosting processes in a server cluster.

Note: Development is fast in the PaaS realm. Docker is being featured in many
new tools and PaaS systems that are being built that do this sort of container
management properly. My goal is to get a minimalistic blueprint in place that
one could use without them that is focused on utilizing many of the same Docker
"best practices" in it's design that these real PaaS tools use.
